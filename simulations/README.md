Simulation

In Progress:\n
Spray and Wait\n\n

Arguements:\n
1. Range - How far can nodes hear and send?  Accepts 1 or more\n
2. Number of Trials - 1 or greater\n
3. Copies - Number of copies for source to spray, nore more than number of nodes minus source\n
4. Number of nodes - 1 or more\n
5. Length of Testing Grid - 2 or more\n
(Won't accept nodes greater than what the area of the grid)\n\n

Nodes successfully move randomly\n
Carrier Sense: \n
1. Node hears no transmissions, it will send message\n
2. Node stores msg in buffer if medium in use\n
3. Node doesn't hear messages if more than one neighbor transmitting at same time\n
Routing in progress: Mechanisms are messy, did not think routing design thoroghly enough before building.\n Still troubleshooting to get nodes to talk.\n
