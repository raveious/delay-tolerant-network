Simulation

In Progress:
Spray and Wait

Nodes successfully move randomly
Carrier Sense: 
1. Node hears no transmissions, it will send message
2. Node stores msg in buffer if medium in use
3. Node doesn't hear messages if more than one neighbor transmitting at same time
Routing in progress: Mechanisms are messy, did not think routing design thoroghly enough before building. Still troubleshooting to get nodes to talk.
